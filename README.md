# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component

## Description
This is a React app built with Vite. It contains a profile component styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX
- How to style with inline CSS
- How to create and render functional components

## Challenges
A challenge I faced during this assignment was when I wanted to change the name for the profile the text color and background color were the same, It was hard to tell if 
I wasn't inputting the name in the right line of code. I fixed it by figuring out the two colors were the same and once I changed the color my text appeared. Another issue
was when I pushed the git and my local host stopped loading. 

## Screenshot
Include a screenshot of your component.
